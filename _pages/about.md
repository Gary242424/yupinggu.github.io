I am a fourth-year PhD candidate in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Hong Kong (HKU), co-supervised by [Prof. Jia Pan](https://sites.google.com/site/panjia) and [Prof. Chaoyang Song](https://bionicdl.ancorasir.com). My research interests include embodied intelligence, computational design, kinematic analysis, motion control, and reinforcement learning.

My current works try to address the key question in the mechanical design problem of embodied intelligence since there are still open questions of which robotic configuration would have the best performance among numerous design principles and task requirements. The proposed computational design frameworks in my studies aim at optimizing the configuration, design parameters, and geometric structures of generalized embodied design for specific tasks, as well as providing instructive insights for designers determining the embodied robotic configurations and parameters in the early stage of the design process.
