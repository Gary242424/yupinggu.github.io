Planar mechanisms dominate modern designs of legged robots with remote actuator placement for robust agility in ground mobility. This paper presents a novel design of robotic leg modules using the Bennett linkage, driven by two coaxially arranged quasi-direct actuators capable of omnidirectional ground locomotion. The Bennett linkage belongs to a family of overconstrained linkages with three-dimensional spatial motion and unparalleled joint axes. We present the first work regarding the design, modeling, and optimization of the Bennett leg module, enabling lateral locomotion, like the crabs, that was not capable with robotic legs designed with common planar mechanisms. We further explored the concept of overconstrained robots, which is a class of advanced robots based on the design reconfiguration of the Bennett leg modules, serving as a potential direction for future research.
