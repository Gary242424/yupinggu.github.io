Locomotion and manipulation are two essential skills in robotics but are often divided or decoupled into two separate problems. It is widely accepted that the topological duality between multi-legged locomotion and multi-fingered manipulation shares an intrinsic model. However, a lack of research remains to identify the data-driven evidence for further research. This paper explores a unified formulation of the loco-manipulation problem using reinforcement learning (RL) by reconfiguring robotic limbs with an overconstrained design into multi-legged and multi-fingered robots. Such design reconfiguration allows for adopting a co-training architecture for reinforcement learning towards a unified loco-manipulation policy. As a result, we find data-driven evidence to support the transferability between locomotion and manipulation skills using a single RL policy with a multilayer perceptron or graph neural network. We also demonstrate the Sim2Real transfer of the learned loco-manipulation skills in a robotic prototype. This work expands the knowledge frontiers on loco-manipulation transferability with learning-based evidence applied in a novel platform with overconstrained robotic limbs.
